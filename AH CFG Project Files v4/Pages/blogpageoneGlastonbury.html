                  <u>Stay Hydrated:</u> There are plenty of water refill stations at Glastonbury, so remember to "leave no trace" and bring reusalble non-glass water bottles with you. If you really want to take staying hydrated seriously, consider bringing a hydration backpack.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <u>Dress Cool:</u> A sun hat is a must for this year's festival, whether your style is a bucket hat, cowboy-style, or wide-brimmed and sophisticated make sure to bring one. For clothing think light flowing layers, breatheable fabrics and light colours. Get creative with your costume outfits too!
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <u>Sunscreen:</u> Don't let uncomfortable sun burn ruin your festival experience. Bring enough sun protection to cover both your face and body, and last the whole weekend.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <u>Use Gadgets:</u> Bring a battery operated mini fan and mini spray bottle filled with water - or combine the two with a misting fan!. Festival veterans also swear by cooling sprays and towels to keep the heat at bay.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <u>Seek Shade:</u> Find shade underneath the many smaller stage and bar tents whenever you can. Umbrellas needn't be just for rainy weather either, they're a great way to create some shade when things get too hot. If you can bring a UV protective umbrella, even better.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <u>Conserve Your Energy:</u> Use a camping chair to rest in between acts and reserve your energy for your favourite performers. Also pack light to minimise having to carry heavy loads to and from your tent in the heat.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  <u>Don't Forget Your Tent!:</u> Try to set up your tent in the shade and use a uv-reflective sun canopy or tarpaulin to keep the sun out. Choosing a tent with mesh panels and air vents will also help keep you comfortable.
                  <br>
                  <br>
                  Above all have fun enjoy this year's packed line up!
